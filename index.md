# CSCI 462 Blog Introduction

I'm  Benji Duke, a computer science major at CofC. I've been here for 2 years now, and my projected graduation date is December, 2020. I  completed an Associate's degree in Computer Technology in 2010 at  Midlands Technical College in West Columbia, then took a left turn and  joined the Navy in 2011 to become a nuclear electrician's mate. I left the Navy in 2017 to go back to school and pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I've always had an interest in computers and programming. Hoping to use my degree to get a start on a new career, either in security or development.
